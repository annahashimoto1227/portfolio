<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>
I was born on December 27, 2000 in El Camino Hospital. Growing up playing competitive tennis, I was determined to become a professional tennis player. My peak was when I was ranked #1 in the girl's division of Northen California. Then, I got tennis elbow and eventually quit competitive tennis. From this point on, I started trying new things such as basketball, swimming, joining the highschool tennis and badminton team, traveling to Japan by myself, making new friends, choosing to attend middle college, and joining the summer immersion Girl's Who Code program.

  <h3> Python </h3>
  
  <h3>Reflections</h3>
  <p>
    I learned that Scratch is mainly Python made easier to understand. For example, on Scratch, there is a multiplication sign, but in Python, it is *. Also, I noticed we learned about loops on both scratch and Python. Differences are that on Scratch, there are limits to what we can do because we can only use commands included in Scratch.

    We faced many problems but we eventually pulled through all of them. One of the biggest problems we had was inputs. We were able to solve this by searching it up online and doing countless trials and errors.It felt great to be able to solve a problem after spending so much time on fixing it.

    A list is a sequence of Python objects, basically in a list. It is used if there are multiple parts that could be changed. Fpr example, we used a list of RGB colors to change the colors of the pixels on a picture. Groups of people that have wide varieties of ideas and lots of knowledge work well together. The person with ideas could think of different ways a program could run. On the other hand, the person with a lot of knowledge could listen to the different ideas and put that into coding. This way, it is most efficient. I liked the obamicon project because I have seen filters on pictures like that before, but it was not as complicated as I imagined it to be.
