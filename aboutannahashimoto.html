<h2>Biography</h2>

<p>
I was born on December 27, 2000 in El Camino Hospital. Growing up playing competitive tennis, I was determined to become a professional tennis player. My peak was when I was ranked #1 in the girl's division of Northen California. Then, I got tennis elbow and eventually quit competitive tennis. From this point on, I started trying new things such as basketball, swimming, joining the highschool tennis and badminton team, traveling to Japan by myself, making new friends, choosing to attend middle college, and joining the summer immersion Girl's Who Code program.
